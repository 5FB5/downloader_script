# pydownloader_script
Simple script for downloading files you need

# System Requirements
Python 3.7 or later.

To install the required libraries run the command from your downloaded repository:
```console
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## How it works
You have 2 downloading mode:
* download multiple links from file "links.txt" (you need to create it, it doesn't have to be only links, it can be a fragment of a chatlog where links to materials or something like that can be specified. Script itself recognizes their presence) - mode "a"
* manual downloading - mode "m"

Just choose mode you want.
