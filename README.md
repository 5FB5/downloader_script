# System Requirements
Python 3.7 or later.

To install the required libraries run the command from your downloaded repository:
```console
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## How it works
You have 2 downloading mode:
* download multiple links from file "links.txt" (you need to create it) - mode "a"
* manual downloading - mode "m"

Just choose mode you want.
